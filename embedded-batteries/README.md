# embedded-batteries

A blocking Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for battery fuel gauges and battery chargers used in embedded systems.

## Intro
This library is a set of traits designed to standardize interactions with battery systems in portable electronics. It follows the [Smart Battery System specification](https://sbs-forum.org/specs/sbdat110.pdf) to define generic functions that all battery chargers and all smart batteries (AKA fuel gauge, gas gauge) must implement to enforce a standard interface.

## Assumptions + Deviations from spec
As there is such a wide range of battery chargers and smart batteries, as well as different ways to electrically connect your smart battery system, a guiding principle of `embedded-batteries` is to make as little assumptions as possible. The SBS spec, which is the basis of the traits, is used as a *guide* rather than a *strict constraint*. Some common deviations and their solutions are listed below:

### Chargers and Fuel Gauges partially/not implementing the SBS spec
Charger and smart battery driver authors are given the flexibility on how their driver implements each SBS function. For example, if the smart battery does not have thermistors onboard, a Result with an "not implemented" error can be returned. Application level code must be able to handle the error accordingly.

### Smart Battery acting as a master
The SBS spec defines that the smart battery should be able to take control of the communication bus and broadcast alert messages. This functionality requires implementation of bus arbitration and as such, is not planned to be supported.
